#  vault-metadata-scanner

A high-performance, C++-based tool to brute-force test metadata access in vault-style APIs such as **1Password**, **LastPass**, or other zero-knowledge cloud password managers â€” **without authentication**.

This tool is part of an independent security research project aimed at identifying real-world unsafe metadata exposure vectors within credential vault systems.

---

##  Features

-  Bruteforces vault/item ID patterns with live response parsing  
-  Simulates unauthenticated attackers (no login required)  
-  Parses HTTP responses (200/403/404/429) and JSON metadata  
-  Terminal logging with color and timestamp  
-  Customizable scan range and sleep timer  
-  No API key or user credentials needed (blackbox scan)
